- **Root Access**: Advanced automation requires device rooting (not recommended)


### **Reliability Factors**[^2][^3]:

- **API Stability**: Official APIs are most reliable but may change
- **UI Dependencies**: Accessibility-based automation breaks with UI updates
- **Network Dependencies**: Cloud-based automations require stable internet
- **App Updates**: Automation may break with major app updates


## Recommended Implementation Strategy

### **Phase 1: Core Automation (70-80% coverage)**[^3]

Focus on high-reliability methods:

- Android Intents for communication
- UPI protocol for payments
- Google APIs for productivity
- Voice assistant integration


### **Phase 2: Enhanced Features (80-90% coverage)**[^3]

Add moderate-reliability methods:
